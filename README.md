# Purpose/Problem Statement  
My program helps navigate user on what waffle choices they want by pressing "menu"  but it's purpose is to show the user how  the API random user works. 
# Target Audience - 
High School students to get a quick and easy aspect of coding. 
# Solution + Limitations 
Showing the user how many rewards they get back after spending money on a waffle. 
# Key Features / Key Components 
 Key features  that were used in making this program is the API-Random user to randomize address and card numbers.  
# Technical Challenges + Future Plans 
When I made the waffle program I had a few challenges coming up with the idea last minute and finding the right API to use with my code but overall I loved every moment when it either failed or had some issues with it because it gave me more ideas each time. 
# Project Timeline 
It  started off when I missed a day at work  because I was sick for a few days and when I came  back from being sick we had to work on a new project. Over time I was overthinking and took a while to pick an idea that best works for me and came up an idea that worked well the last time  and it being my future plan which is opening up my own Waffle House in Philadelphia  it took me a while to come up how will this work and why I chose this but in the end it worked out well. 
# Tools and Resources Used 
I used the API website to come up with the code and I chose the API random user and I edited my old code and combine it with the API random user to randomize the users address and card number.
